My name is Daniel Adrian. I was graduated in Electrical Engineering at Trisakti University. My journey in programming was started with computer virus. At that time, I was motivated to debug a virus program to understand its behavior. My target was creating my own antivirus program. Accidentally, learning virus program led me to learn more in networking and web technology like HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, C, Java and MySQL database.
</p><p align="justify">
At my undergraduate level, I learnt hardware like AT89s51, AVR, PLC and ARM. I had done several project like line follower robot and automatic garden watering (<a href="page-experience">Check this !</a>). I also started to learn new programming language like phyton and golang. 
</p><p align="justify">
In addition, I also have passion in teaching. Since high school, my friends always asked me when they have difficulties about computer such as: school project, programming, animation, and computer virus. In University, I became computer laboratory assistant, joined the community service as an assistant, and created module for programming practicum.
</p><p align="justify">
In the future, I am visioning myself as a researcher and technopreneur. I believe technology field is a bridge for me to help others and create big impact to the world.
